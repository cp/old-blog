  <h1> How I Use Simplenote </h1>
  
  <p class="date">Posted 27 August 2012</p>
<p>I discovered <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> quite some time ago through a podcast I listen to, but have just recently decided to try it out. If you are unaware of what Simplenote is, it’s a freemium service that allows you to sync notes, essentially .txt files, easily across your Mac, PC, and iOS device using 1st and <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/downloads/">3rd party apps</a>. Since signing up I’ve been paying for the $2/month <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/premium/">premium plan</a> that comes with a couple extra features as well as premium support.</p>

<p>I use Simplenote pretty much as a braindump. The files in my Simplenote are somewhat unorganized. The main file is a my todo list, where I simply jot down all the things I have to do that I probably would not remember without the list. My Simplenote is also full of business ideas, books to read, fonts I like, blog posts (like this one) and websites that I think are well designed.</p>

<p>I use a couple different Simplenote apps. Justnotes on the Mac and Listary as well as the official app on the iPhone.</p>

<p><strong>Justnotes [<a href="http://selfcoded.com/justnotes/">Link</a>]</strong><br/>
Justnotes is one of the most simple and beautiful Mac apps that I’ve used. It integrates seamlessly with Simplenote and can also back up to your Mac’s local drive. I keep it open whenever I’m on my mac and use it to keep track of everything; code, todo lists, books to read, movies to watch.</p>

<p><strong>Listary [<a href="http://listaryapp.com/">Link</a>]</strong><br/>
Listary is a great iOS app for keeping lists and syncing them with Simplenote. I use it when I’m on the go and need to add something to my todo list, or hear of a book that I’d like to read.</p>

<p>Simplenote is one of those services that just works. You don’t have to think about it, you just use it. I recommend that you try it… the free version is great and the paid version is always there if you find that you crave more.</p>
