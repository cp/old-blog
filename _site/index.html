          <h1><a href="/watching-from-the-sidelines.html" class="posttitle" rel="bookmark">Watching From The Sidelines</a></h1>
          <p class="date">Posted 19 March 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>It's not rare that I stumble upon a blog post where the founder of a startup talks about their launch, how many users they signed up, and how much they learned from it. Well, I think that you can learn a lot from other people's startups too, without having to take part in them. I think the ability to learn from startups that aren't yours is very useful. Here's how I learn from products and the people behind them, all while just watching from the sidelines.</p>

<p>Whenever a new social networking service emerges I usually sign up and try it out, usually to see what the hype is about and to give it a fair chance. I do this because trying out other  apps and services is a great way to learn how to create your own. It's a great chance to learn how they launched and created hype, why people are using it, how effective their signup process is, and most importantly, what aspects of the service you should or should not use in your next project.</p>

<p>There's a lot you can learn from launches, but if you actually spend some time and use the service, you end up learning a lot more. For as much as the launch exposes about the service and the people behind it, they only undercover a fraction of the methodology behind it.</p>

<p>It's important to ask questions such as why are people using it? What real problems does it solve? If there's other services already doing something like this, what makes it special?</p>

<hr />

<p>Let's use <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> as an example. Foursquare launched four years ago, but students at my high school are just now beginning to use it. Why now? Why are they using it over Facebook's Places feature, where most students already have accounts? Thanks to the notifications I receive whenever a Facebook friend of mine signs up for Foursquare, I have been able to see exactly how the service is spreading throughout my school. First it was one group of friends, then it spread to another. After becoming Foursquare friends with a few of these people, I was interested to see that many of their checkins have photos attached. From what I've seen, they take many more photos than my original Foursquare friends. Why? Facebook already allows you to attach photos to Places checkins. What makes Foursquare more appealing?</p>

<p>How is Foursquare targeting these people? From what I can tell, they're using Facebook and Twitter, services the students are already on. Once they can get a few key people to join, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a> will start doing it's thing, and more and more students will begin to sign up because their friends wanted them to.</p>

<p>Foursquare aimed at early adopters first, then relied on existing social networks and word of mouth to spread to the average consumer.</p>

<hr />

<p>Foursquare is just one example. I challenge you to sit down and consider how other startups launched, and moved from the early adopter stage to the average consumer stage. What techniques did they use? How did they target the early adopters? Most importantly, how can you apply these techniques to your own startup?</p>

<p>Digging below the surface and analyzing products and their launches can be very helpful. There's a lot that you can learn without having to really do anything yourself. What kind of questions will you ponder?</p>

          <p class="date">Posted 12 March 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>I find T-Shirts to be fascinating. Give someone a free t-shirt, and unless the content is unnecessairly absurd they will probably wear it.</p>

<p>Why? My guess is that it's because T-Shirts usually cost a fairly substancial amount of money in stores, but branded T-Shirts such as ones with company logos across the front are usually free.</p>

<p>I've caught myself wearing a T-Shirt before with the logo of a company I don't even care about printed across the front in large bold letters. As far as I know, I've seen other people do it too.</p>

<p>What fascinates me is that T-Shirts seem to be the only product that we will do this too. Imagine a company giving you a bumber sticker. Unless you truly loved or worked for the company, would you put it on your car? What if they gave you a free T-Shirt, what are the chances that you would wear it at least once?</p>

          <div class="post">
            <p>Here’s what <a href="http://jacksongariety.com">Jackson Gariety</a> and I have been working on for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The List is a social knowledge aggregator, a link sharing site with a focus on high quality content. We’ve identified many of the key problems with other link sharing sites such as <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and Reddit, and addressed those with The List.</p>

<p>For example, one key aspect of The List is that you have to be invited to post, and posting will cost you credits. This forces people to question the quality of the content before they post, which in turn will promote higher quality links.</p>

<p>We created The List because we wanted a place to go and find high quality articles related to tech and business. Hopefully you’ll find it helpful as well.</p>

            <blockquote><p>The most common thing I hear from aspiring entrepreneurs is, “I have this idea for an app or site. But I’m not technical, so I need to find someone who can make it for me.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A great blog post that explains why it is important for everyone, especially entrepreneurs, to learn basic programming. He brings up a great point: If you need to make a site, or make a prototype for your new idea, why rely on someone else? Why not learn how to do it yourself?</p>

          <p class="date">Posted 10 January 2013</p>
          <div class="post">
            <p>Since the inception of the personal computer, using one has been seen as something unhealthy. Something that causes eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and back pains. This has done more than cause trips to the hospital, but has given computers the negative connotations of being unnatural, unsafe, and unhealthy.</p>

<p>Computers are becoming more and more present in our every day lives, but at the same time they haven't become any safer to use. More and more jobs involve using computers on a daily basis, yet using one is often seen as unhealthy. In fact, from what I have observed people will naturally limit their computer use because they believe that using one is unnatural and wrong. With something proven to help us in so many ways, why should this still be happening?</p>

<p>How can we make computers safer to use, and in turn shift in how people use them, and how they are perceived?</p>

<p>With the rising number of computers in the home, the workplace, and now in the pocket, this is extremely important. It is something worth thinking about — “What can be done to make computers safer and more natural to use?” I'm not talking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trek-TD-01-TrekDesk-Treadmill-Desk/dp/B002IYRBI0">treadmill desks</a>. No, I'm talking about designing computers to have less negative health effects, which will in turn fundamentally alter how people think of, and use them.</p>

<p>There's a huge opportunity for the first person to figure this out, and an even larger one for the first person to do it right.</p>
