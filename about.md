##Hi, I'm Colby.

**I'm a 16 year old student from Portland, Oregon with an interest in business, startups, and technology.**

I enjoy using computers and the internet to make things that not only people enjoy using, but that solve problems.

###Projects

I started a thing called a [Hackalone](http://hackalone.org) with a couple of friends, with a goal of making it easy and fun to tinker with new concepts and technologies.

I helped organize [CodeDay Portland](http://portland.codeday.org), a 24 hour hackathon for high school and college students.

I created [The List](http://thelist.io) with my friend [Jackson Gariety](http://jacksongariety.com), with a goal of making it easier for developers, entreprenuers, and designers to find high quality content online.

I'm also a Business Analyst intern at [Launchside](http://launchside.com), a local development studio here in Portland.

###About this blog

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on a [Linode](http://linode.com). The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/ColbyAley/ColbyAley.com). Feel free to contact me if you need help setting up your own Jekyll blog.

I have used [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) for years, but recently switched to Jekyll because of speed and simplicity.

I am using [Gauges](http://get.gaug.es) to monitor the traffic on this blog. I use [GoSquared](http://gosquared.com) on many of my projects.

###Contact me

I love to talk to people about code, computers, and startups. Feel free to shoot me an email at [colby@aley.me](mailto://colby@aley.me).

Keep rockin'.
